# Turtle-Race-code

This is a code that consists of 8 different coloured turtles that are all participating in a race. The user is first asked if they want to commence the race. Each turtle will simultaniously go forward by a random increment, stop, and then repeat. They will continue to go forward until one reaches the end line. The winner will then be outputted to the user.
